#This is further practive bfore the test on Sunday. I will be reading the chapters again from the pcep website and having some of the practice executed here

###--Practice and review questions before PCEP--###
#Same as from the 21st day of code practice
# I have gotten some of these practice problems from https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html

#Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.


a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

print(f"Original list is {a}, and the even numbers are:\n{[item for item in a if item%2 ==0]}")
