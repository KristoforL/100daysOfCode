# 100daysOfCode
Coding for 100 days in different languages in practice of getting certifications

I am python PCEP certified as of November 8th 2020


Each day is gradually getting more advanced as the days go on. 

Udemy days of code will be following a Udemy course while the Python Crash course files will be work I have revisited from Learning Python to start my 100 days of code. They will be moved into a folder of their own soon so that there is no cofusion with what content belongs to each other.
