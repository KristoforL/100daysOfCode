#Focusing on OOP and making sure we understand Object Oriented Programming concepts

#The Coffee machine from Day 15 used procedural programming where the code is ran from top to bottom and jumping into functions as needed


#Classes and Objects
#Classes are the stencil for the object
# Objects have attributes(Variable associated with object) and methods(Function that an object would do)

#Classes are just blueprints for objects
