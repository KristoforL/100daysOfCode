print('Hello World')    

#Day 1 Challenge 1 asked me to print the following: 
# Day 1 - Python Print Function
# The function is declared like this:
# print('what to print')
print('Day 1 - Python Print Function')
print('What to print?')
print("print('what to print')")

#Here we will learn about manipulating the strings
#New lines use \n which means new line
#We can add strings together as well with concatination
print('This is all on the same line\nin the code')
print('Hello ' + 'Kris')

#Day 1 challenge 2 asked me to correct the following code:
# print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")- missing quotation
# print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.") - The plus sign is part of the string and not adding the strings together
#   print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')- Indenting problems
# print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.") - extra parenthesis

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the '+' sign.")
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
