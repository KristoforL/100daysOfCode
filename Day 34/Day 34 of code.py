#This is further practive bfore the test on Sunday. I will be reading the chapters again from the pcep website and having some of the practice executed here

###--Practice and review questions before PCEP--###
#Same as from the 21st day of code practice
# I have gotten some of these practice problems from https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html

# Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

# Extras:

# Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and constructing a list, and another using sets.
# Go back and do Exercise 5 using sets, and write the solution for that in a different function.
