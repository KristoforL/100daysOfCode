#Today was used to setup pycharm for windows and pc 

#I use visual studio code so I will not be changing but it is nice to know what pycharm offers


#The final project will be creating a coffee machine, that takes in money and manages resources for creating the coffee


#This program will do the following:
#1. Print a report 
#2. Check resources sufficient
#3. Process coins
#4. Check transaction successful
