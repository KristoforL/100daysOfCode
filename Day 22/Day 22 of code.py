#Day 22 of Code

### Practice in understanding bitwise operators ###


# & Bitwise Operator
# The & bitwise operator will combine the bits for each number and return 1 if both are 1 at the same position
print(11 & 12)
#1011 & 1100 = 1000
#1000 is the bit for 8


# | Bitwise operator
# The | operator will combine the bits for the numbers and place a 1 if either of the two bits being compared are 1
print(11 | 12)
#1011 & 1100 = 1111
#1111 is the bit for 15


print(11<<2)


print(11>>2)


print(11^12)


print(~11)


print(~57)

print(~14)

print(~333)
