#This is further practive bfore the test on Sunday. I will be reading the chapters again from the pcep website and having some of the practice executed here

###--Practice and review questions before PCEP--###
#Same as from the 21st day of code practice
# I have gotten some of these practice problems from https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html

# Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise)

# Extras:

# Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
# Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.
