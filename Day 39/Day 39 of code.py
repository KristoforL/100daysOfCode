###--Practice and review questions before PCEP--###
#Same as from the 21st day of code practice
# I have gotten some of these practice problems from https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html

# Using the requests and BeautifulSoup Python libraries, print to the screen the full text of the article on this website: http://www.vanityfair.com/society/2014/06/monica-lewinsky-humiliation-culture.

# The article is long, so it is split up between 4 pages. Your task is to print out the text to the screen so that you can read the full article without having to click any buttons.
