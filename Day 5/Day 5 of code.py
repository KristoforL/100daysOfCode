#Day 5 of Code

### Blocks printed with hyphens between are seperate lessons and will have comments for what is covered in the space ###

###--Coditional statements continued with if else, and if elif else statements --###

#Alien colors 1: Create alien color variable, assign color, write if statement to check color and print same color if it is. Write fail to output nothing
color = "green"
if color == "green":
    print("5pts")

color == "red"
if color == "green":
    print("5pts")

#Alien color 2: Same as above and use if else sstatemt for green and yellow

if color == "green":
    print("5pts")
else:
    print("10pts")

color == "green"
if color == "green":
    print("5pts")
else:
    print("10pts")

#Alien color 3: Turn the last practice to and if elif else statement
if color == "green":
    print("5pts")
elif color == "yellow":
    print("10pts")
else:
    print("15pts")

color = "yellow"
if color == "green":
    print("5pts")
elif color == "yellow":
    print("10pts")
else:
    print("15pts")

color = "red"

if color == "green":
    print("5pts")
elif color == "yellow":
    print("10pts")
else:
    print("15pts")


#Stages of life: set variable to age and create an if elif else block to determine stage of life

elif age < 13:
    print("Kid")
elif age < 20:
    print("Teen")
