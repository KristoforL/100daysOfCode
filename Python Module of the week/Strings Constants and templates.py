#Python Module of the week wehere I will be looking into the strings constants and templates

#Capwords: This function capitalizes the words in the string

import string

s = "i really like pie. i can't wait for thanksgiving."
print(s)
print(string.capwords(s))

#You can get the same results from splitting the string capitalizing each word then joining them back together. 

#

value = {'foo':'var'}
